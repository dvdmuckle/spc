## spc switch

Set device to use for all callbacks

### Synopsis

Set the device to use when controlling Spotify playback.
If this entry is empty, it will default to the currently playing device.
You can clear the set device entry if the device is no longer active.
This will also switch playback to the device selected if playback is active,
