## spc search

Search for and play a track, album, playlist, or artist

### Synopsis

Search takes two arguments: the search type, and the query.
Search type can be an album, a track, a playlist, or an artist, with the rest of the arguments
making up the search query. For example:

	spc search album moving pictures
	spc search track tom sawyer
	spc search playlist prog monsters
	spc search artist rush

If a track is queried for, additional similar songs will be queued up.

More advanced options are availble for the search query. For this,
