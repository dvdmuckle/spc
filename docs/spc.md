## spc

Command line tool to control Spotify

### Synopsis

Spc is a simple command line tool to control Spotify using the Spotify API
to allow for cross platform use. It is designed to be simple and is limited in
scope, and is best when paired with another more complicated tool.

### Options

```
      --alsologtostderr                  log to standard error as well as files
      --config string                    Config file (default is $HOME/.config/spc/config.yaml)
  -h, --help                             help for spc
      --log_backtrace_at traceLocation   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace (default :0)
      --log_dir string                   If non-empty, write log files in this directory
      --logtostderr                      log to standard error instead of files
      --stderrthreshold severity         logs at or above this threshold go to stderr (default 2)
  -v, --v Level                          log level for V logs
